# Easy-Box
The purpose of the Easy Box project is to create a device that replicates as faithfully as possible the functionality of a normal easy box, used in the regular practice of storing parcels in specially designed lockers for pickup by a courier.
By implementing this device, we aim to achieve a solution that provides a similar experience to that of a standard easy box, with a focus on accurately measuring object dimensions and automatically selecting the appropriate boxes.

Another important objective is ensuring the security of objects inside the boxes. The system must be able to properly close and secure the boxes to prevent damage or loss of the contents.
Therefore, the ultimate goal is to create a device that offers a complete and efficient solution for storing objects, replicating the functionalities and characteristics of a normal easy box as closely as possible.
